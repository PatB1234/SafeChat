# safechat
The best chatting website of all time
#Description
What is safe chat? Safe chat is a chatting platform specifically developed for school created by Pratyush Bindal and Raviish Panicker with help from our teacher Somu Gosh. It is a versatile platform for students to chat and for teachers to share material. Ontop of this we plan to create functionality for students and teachers to chat with parents for things such as parent teacher meetings. This is can be pricless during COVID or anything of the sort. Along with this students have the possibility to report bullying completley anonomously.
